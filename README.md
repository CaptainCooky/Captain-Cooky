# Hello! I'm Captain Cooky

I am a devoted parent and an enthusiastic gamer. I value honour and loyalty above all else. Game design and development are how I spend much of my time. From 3D modelling and texturing to coding and development, I’m a passionate and energetic creator. When I'm not creating, I’ll be gaming, camping, or just hanging at the beach with my amazing kids!

I am currently collaborating with talented creators ArtsByKev and TersHD on their YouTube channels. Together, we work on exciting projects, including new Minecraft Marketplace content and custom content for our channels.

To keep up to date with what I'm up to, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/captainevie) and check out my YouTube channel [CaptainCooky](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptainCooky). You can also find ArtsByKev on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtsByKev) and TersHD on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ImTerasHD).

Stay tuned for more adventures and creative projects!
