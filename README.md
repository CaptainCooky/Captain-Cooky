# Hello! I'm Captain Cooky

I am a cheerful Father, Husband, and enthusiastic Gamer.      
      
I value honour and loyalty above all else. 
I love having the opportunity to create fun and enjoyment through Game Design and Development.    
From 3D Modelling and Texturing to Coding and Development, I hope always to be a passionate and energetic Creator.   
You'll find me hanging out with my fantastic family when I'm not Creating! Whether it be Gaming, Camping, or just hanging at the beach, we always make it fun!

Recently, I have been working as apart of the [Nexus Mob Studio Team](https://www.nexusmob.com/minecraft-marketplace), a Minecraft Marketplace Partner.   
Together we are working on exciting projects including new Minecraft Marketplace content as well as custom content for some popular Minecraft Youtubers!

To keep up to date with what I'm up to, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CaptainsRoving).

If you would like to download some of my free Minecraft Bedrock Add-ons, you'll find them on my [Website](https://www.captaincooky.com/).
